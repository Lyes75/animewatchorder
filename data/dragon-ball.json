You don\u2019t need to watch both.</li><li><strong>Dragon Ball GT</strong> \u2014 Not written by Toriyama. Mostly disliked by fans. Canon status: officially non-canon since Super was created as the true continuation.</li><li><strong>The films</strong> \u2014 Out of 23 films, only 4 are canon. The rest are fun standalone stories that don\u2019t affect the main plot.</li><li><strong>Dragon Ball Super: Broly</strong> \u2014 This film canonically replaces the two original Broly films.

Dragon Ball Super effectively replaced GT as the canonical continuation. That said, GT has its moments \u2014 the Super Saiyan 4 transformation is iconic, and the final episode is genuinely emotional. Watch it if you're a completionist, skip it if you want to stick to canon."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Dragon Ball GT canon?",
        "answer": "No. Dragon Ball GT is not considered canon. It exists in an alternate timeline separate from the main continuity established by Akira Toriyama. Dragon Ball Super is the official canonical sequel to Dragon Ball Z."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to watch Dragon Ball before Dragon Ball Z?",
        "answer": "Technically no, but strongly recommended. Dragon Ball introduces Goku, the core cast, and the world-building that DBZ builds upon. Many emotional moments in Z hit harder with DB context. If you absolutely can't commit, you can start with Z/Kai, but you'll miss important character development."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where can I watch all of Dragon Ball?",
        "answer": "Crunchyroll has the most complete Dragon Ball library, including Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball Super, Dragon Ball GT, Dragon Ball Daima, and most of the films. Some films may also be available on Amazon Prime Video or Netflix depending on your region."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does it take to watch all of Dragon Ball?",
        "answer": "Watching everything (all series + all films) takes approximately 800+ hours. The Essentialist path (canon only) takes about 350 hours. The Standard recommended path takes about 360 hours. The Completionist path with GT and all fillers reaches approximately 900 hours."
      },
      {
        "question": "What order should I watch the Dragon Ball Super movies?",
        "answer": "The four canon DBS-era films should be watched in this order: Battle of Gods (after DBZ/Kai), Resurrection F (after Battle of Gods), Dragon Ball Super: Broly (after DBS episode 131), and Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero (after Broly). Note that Battle of Gods and Resurrection F are retold in DBS episodes 1-27, so you can skip the films if you're watching the series."

Dragon Ball Super a effectivement remplac\u00e9 GT comme suite canonique. Cela dit, GT a ses moments \u2014 la transformation Super Saiyan 4 est embl\u00e9matique, et le dernier \u00e9pisode est \u00e9mouvant. Regardez-le si vous \u00eates compl\u00e9tiste, sautez-le si vous voulez rester sur le canon."

        "question": "Est-ce que Dragon Ball GT est canon ?",
        "answer": "Non. Dragon Ball GT n'est pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme canon. Il existe dans une timeline alternative, s\u00e9par\u00e9e de la continuit\u00e9 principale \u00e9tablie par Akira Toriyama. Dragon Ball Super est la suite canonique officielle de Dragon Ball Z."

      {
        "question": "Faut-il regarder Dragon Ball avant Dragon Ball Z ?",
        "answer": "Techniquement non, mais c'est fortement recommand\u00e9. Dragon Ball pr\u00e9sente Goku, le casting principal et l'univers sur lequel DBZ se construit. De nombreux moments \u00e9motionnels dans Z ont plus d'impact avec le contexte de DB. Si vous ne pouvez vraiment pas vous engager, vous pouvez commencer par Z/Kai, mais vous manquerez un d\u00e9veloppement important des personnages."

      {
        "question": "Combien de temps faut-il pour regarder tout Dragon Ball ?",
        "answer": "Tout regarder (toutes les s\u00e9ries + tous les films) prend environ 800+ heures. Le parcours Essentialiste (canon uniquement) prend environ 350 heures. Le parcours Standard recommand\u00e9 prend environ 360 heures. Le parcours Compl\u00e9tiste avec GT et tous les fillers atteint environ 900 heures."
      },
      {
        "question": "Dans quel ordre regarder les films Dragon Ball Super ?",
        "answer": "Les quatre films canon de l'\u00e8re DBS doivent \u00eatre regard\u00e9s dans cet ordre : Battle of Gods (apr\u00e8s DBZ/Kai), Resurrection F (apr\u00e8s Battle of Gods), Dragon Ball Super: Broly (apr\u00e8s DBS \u00e9pisode 131), et Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero (apr\u00e8s Broly). Notez que Battle of Gods et Resurrection F sont repris dans les \u00e9pisodes 1-27 de DBS, donc vous pouvez sauter les films si vous regardez la s\u00e9rie."
