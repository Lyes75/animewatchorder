Insert <strong>Super: Broly</strong> right after DBS episode 131, then <strong>Super Hero</strong> after that. Skip <strong>GT</strong> unless you want everything — it’s non-canon and takes place in an alternate timeline. For films, the only ones that <em>matter</em> are <strong>Battle of Gods</strong>, <strong>Resurrection F</strong>, <strong>Broly</strong>, and <strong>Super Hero</strong> — all others are enjoyable but non-essential.",

      "content": "Unlike most anime, Dragon Ball has been remade, retconned, and expanded over 40 years. Here’s what trips people up:<ul><li><strong>DBZ vs Dragon Ball Kai</strong> — Kai is a remastered, heavily trimmed version of DBZ. Same story, ~45% fewer episodes, almost no filler. You don’t need to watch both.</li><li><strong>Dragon Ball GT</strong> — Not written by Toriyama. Mostly disliked by fans. Canon status: officially non-canon since Super was created as the true continuation.</li><li><strong>The films</strong> — Out of 23 films, only 4 are canon. The rest are fun standalone stories that don’t affect the main plot.</li><li><strong>Dragon Ball Super: Broly</strong> — This film canonically replaces the two original Broly films. If you’ve seen those, you can still watch this one.</li></ul>"

GT is non-canon — it was created by Toei Animation without Akira Toriyama’s involvement, and Dragon Ball Super was later created as the official continuation, effectively replacing GT. Most fans recommend skipping it, at least on a first watch. If you’re curious, watch it after finishing Super and Daima."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Dragon Ball GT canon?",
        "answer": "No. GT is officially non-canon. When Toriyama created Dragon Ball Super, he explicitly stated it was the true continuation after the Majin Buu Saga, which made GT an alternate timeline. You won’t miss anything story-relevant by skipping it."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to watch Dragon Ball before Dragon Ball Z?",
        "answer": "Technically no, but strongly recommended. Dragon Ball introduces all the core characters, Goku’s origin, the Dragon Balls themselves, and the early power system. Many emotional moments in DBZ hit harder when you know the characters from the beginning. Plan for around 50 hours — it’s worth it."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where can I watch all of Dragon Ball?",
        "answer": "Crunchyroll is your best single destination — it has Dragon Ball, DBZ, Kai, Super, GT, Daima, and most films. Netflix has a partial selection including recent films. Amazon Prime Video also carries the main series. For film completionists, some older non-canon films may require purchase on digital platforms."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does it take to watch all of Dragon Ball?",
        "answer": "It depends heavily on your path. Canon essentials only (Kai + Super + Daima + 4 canon films): roughly 350 hours. The standard experience with DBZ and recommended films: around 360 hours. The full completionist path including GT and all 23 films: 900+ hours. Most people binge the essential path over 3–6 months watching a few episodes per day."
      },
      {
        "question": "What order should I watch the Dragon Ball Super movies?",
        "answer": "Battle of Gods first (it introduces Beerus and Super Saiyan God), then Resurrection ‘F’ (Frieza returns), then watch Dragon Ball Super the series (you can skip episodes 1–27 since the films cover that arc). After the series ends at episode 131, watch Super: Broly, then Super Hero, then Daima."

      {
        "question": "Faut-il regarder Dragon Ball GT ?",
        "answer": "Seulement si vous voulez tout voir. GT est non-canon — il a été créé par Toei Animation sans l’implication d’Akira Toriyama, et Dragon Ball Super a ensuite été créé comme la suite officielle, remplaçant effectivement GT. La plupart des fans recommandent de le passer, du moins lors d’un premier visionnage. Si vous êtes curieux, regardez-le après avoir terminé Super et Daima."
      },
      {
        "question": "Est-ce que Dragon Ball GT est canon ?",
        "answer": "Non. GT est officiellement non-canon. Lorsque Toriyama a créé Dragon Ball Super, il a explicitement déclaré que c’était la vraie suite après la Saga Majin Buu, ce qui a fait de GT une timeline alternative. Vous ne manquerez rien d’important pour l’histoire en le passant."
      },
      {
        "question": "Faut-il regarder Dragon Ball avant Dragon Ball Z ?",
        "answer": "Techniquement non, mais c’est fortement recommandé. Dragon Ball présente tous les personnages principaux, l’origine de Goku, les Dragon Balls eux-mêmes et le système de puissance initial. De nombreux moments émotionnels dans DBZ ont plus d’impact quand vous connaissez les personnages depuis le début. Comptez environ 50 heures — ça vaut le coup."
      },
      {
        "question": "Où peut-on regarder tout Dragon Ball ?",
        "answer": "Crunchyroll est votre meilleure destination unique — il possède Dragon Ball, DBZ, Kai, Super, GT, Daima et la plupart des films. Netflix propose une sélection partielle incluant des films récents. Amazon Prime Video propose également les séries principales. Pour les complétistes de films, certains anciens films non-canon peuvent nécessiter un achat sur des plateformes numériques."
      },
      {
        "question": "Combien de temps faut-il pour regarder tout Dragon Ball ?",
        "answer": "Cela dépend beaucoup de votre parcours. L’essentiel canon uniquement (Kai + Super + Daima + 4 films canon) : environ 350 heures. L’expérience standard avec DBZ et les films recommandés : environ 360 heures. Le parcours complétiste incluant GT et les 23 films : 900+ heures. La plupart des gens font le parcours essentiel en 3 à 6 mois en regardant quelques épisodes par jour."
      },
      {
        "question": "Dans quel ordre regarder les films Dragon Ball Super ?",
        "answer": "Battle of Gods en premier (il introduit Beerus et le Super Saiyan Dieu), puis La Résurrection de F (Frieza revient), puis regardez la série Dragon Ball Super (vous pouvez sauter les épisodes 1–27 car les films couvrent cet arc). Après la fin de la série à l’épisode 131, regardez Super: Broly, puis Super Hero, puis Daima."
